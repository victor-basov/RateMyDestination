A Map Application developed using MongoDB, Express, React, Node, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git, and the Mapbox API. Deployed using Heroku. 
The application allows for the user to sign up for an account and then login. 
After login, the user can drop a pin anywhere on the map of the world and give the spot a rating and a review. 
The user’s pins are orange, while other user’s pins on the map are purple. The data is stored in MongoDB.
